Hi, my name is Nazkitten! 
My goal is to help make simple guides. What kind? Well they are more spur of the moment ones. 
Currently working on a few. I wont make a list as I am still working on it. But I am hoping to create a simple guide to easily get one going with whatever project tehy go with. 
I wont make video tutorials as the channel I have currently is gaming focused. So please don't request me to do stuff like that. 
No, I am not going to list ways to contact me as I Am going to try and make sure the tutorials I make will be used with projects that dont really change that much (Arch). 

Profile, projects, files and everything else is a WIP. Please be patient.
